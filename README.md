Clickjacking is a malicious technique of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, effectively hijacking clicks meant for another function. This tool helps in identifying if a website is protected against such attacks.

## Features

- Checks for the presence of `X-Frame-Options` header.
- Identifies if the `X-Frame-Options` header value is properly set to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`.
- Provides an option to log response headers for detailed analysis.
- Easy to use command-line interface.
